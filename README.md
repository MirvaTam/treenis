This was the first (2 week) project I did during my studies at Omnia. 
I developed this band rehearsal studio agreement portal, where you can sign in and submit information to your agreement.
I used a tutorial from the web to get things started. (So it is not made by me from scratch.)
It is a working consept. 
Eventhough there are a couple of mistakes in the code, some checking functions are nor working properly.
I plan to fix them once I get my second project underway...
